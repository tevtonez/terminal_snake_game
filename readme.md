# Snake-ish terminal game
A simple terminal game written in Python for my 7 years old son

## Install, Run, Play Instructions:

1. Download repository and navigate into it in terminal window
2. Run `main.py` file with Python 2.7:
`python main.py`
3. Use **WASD** buttons to navigate. You must hit **Enter** every time after pressing navigation button. Yeah, that's sucks but we'll cope with it, right? :)
4. Eat triangle shapes on the field that are randomly generated for you and earn some game points.
5. Once all triangles are collected the games ends.
6. If you hit the "wall" the game ends too.

## Have fun!
